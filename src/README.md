# Source code (src) folder

This folders is where all the source codes of the project live. It is structured into 2 subfolders:

- `notebooks`: contains the analysis in Jupyter Notebook forms. Each notebooks focuses on the analysis flows and findings, hence most of the code would be abstracted in function forms into the corresponding .py/.R scripts, which are stored in the `scripts` folder.
  
- `scripts`: contains the detailed code for the functions used in the Jupyter Notebooks as well as other part of the project.
